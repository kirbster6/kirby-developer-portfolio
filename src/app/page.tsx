        <p>
          I'm a software developer finishing my final quarter of school at UC
          Irvine. I'm an ex-SDE Intern at Amazon where I worked as a full-stack
          developer. I've dedicated a large part of my college engaging with the
          student body as Co-President of ICSSC and a Logistics Organizer for
          Hack@UCI.

          I have delved into many areas of software development, from
          full-stack, to mobile, to game design, to embedded software, and my
          interests are always growing. I'm currently exploring CUDA, AR, and
          growing my full-stack skills.
